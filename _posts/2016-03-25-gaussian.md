This post is the first of a series for which I will give some practical examples in which statistics (i. e., any function of the data) will perform poor if the data sample is assumed to be Gaussian distributed.

Sometimes we tend to assume that our data samples are Gaussian distributed without actually be certain about this. 

With the Gaussian assumption comes several goodies that we know, for instance, the density is smooth everywhere, the likelihood function is easy to write analytically and to compute, the maximum likelihood estimator coincides with the classical least squares estimator (which one can use to fit almost any model to the data), and so on... (Perhaps the least squares is the most used objective function ever).

_To be continued..._
