<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Hi everyone!
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify'>
I'm delighted to announce that I got the opportunity to join the K2 Guest Observer (GO)
Office at NASA Ames as an intern =D!
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify'>
The prime mission of the K2 GO Office is to be a bridge between the K2 mission operations and the scientific community.
One road of this bridge provides technical support to the scientific community by developing open source softwares, e.g.,
PyKE.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify'>
PyKE software is a set of python tasks developed by Martin Still and Tom Barclay for analysis of Kepler time-series data.
Long story short, PyKE is no longer functional mainly because of broken dependencies and a few critical bugs :(.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify'>
One of my responsibilities is to make PyKE top notch again =)!
</p>

This is going to be achived by doing the following:

* Fixing critical bugs
* Writing unit tests
* Making PyKE an installable package
* Updating dependencies
* Providing documentation on Sphinx
* Creating user-friendly command-line tools

<p style='text-align: justify'>
Stay tuned to the Github repo I've created to revamp PyKE <a href="http://www.github.com/mirca/pykex">here</a>.
</p>
