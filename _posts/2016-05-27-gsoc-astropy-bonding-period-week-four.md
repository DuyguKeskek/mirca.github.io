Third and fourth weeks of the bonding period are over!

During the fourth week I was having final exams, so I did not work much.

Good thing though is that I pretty much finished implementing the `daogroup` routine. I wrote a basic test to ensure it works properly and also I visually check the results on an aritificial image. More and robust tests should be implemented soon.

Now, I'm concentrating my efforts on implementing the `nstar` routine.

*Now, to work*! :)
