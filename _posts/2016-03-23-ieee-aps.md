Today I just received an awesome message. I have been contemplated with a travel grant from IEEE APS to present my paper at the IEEE APS/URSI conference which will be held in Puerto Rico! :)

My paper is about a derivation of a new envelope-phase joint density function for the exponentiated-Weibull fading in free space optical communication channels.

Since this is a work in progress, there is a lot to be done (I will just not have time in the next 4 months)! For instance, we did not derive a closed-form expression for the phase marginal pdf! (The integral is pretty scary :x). However, I've done it numerically. And it looks like this:

I just can't wait to come back to US even for just a week (:
