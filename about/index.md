Hi, I'm ZÃ©. I'm an undergraduate student pursing Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Campina Grande, Brazil. Since my first year in college, I've been with the Institute for Advanced Studies in Communications (Iecom) as an undergraduate research assistant working with image processing and communications.

In the Summer of 2015, I worked as an undergraduate guest researcher with the Nanofabrication Research Group in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA. In that opportunity, I wrote MATLAB code for single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) and fluorescense localization imaging microscopy (FLIM).

Currently, I hold a teaching assistant scholarship for the course of Probability and Statistics for Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. After graduation, I plan to apply to a PhD program in Optics.

Besides loving math, physics, and programming, I also enjoy music, coffee, chess, running, and soccer. I'm also keen on math contests and russian probability books.

I'm a Nature and Smile :) lover.
